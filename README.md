By using tableau and dataset from kaggle made Line graph, bar chart and tree map for Soccer world cup.
Tableau's powerful data visualization capabilities and a comprehensive FIFA World Cup dataset sourced from Kaggle, a series of insightful visualizations were created to delve into the rich history and trends of this global sporting spectacle. Specifically, line graphs, bar charts, and treemaps were employed to illuminate various facets of the World Cup.

Line graphs tracked the evolution of key metrics over time, such as total goals scored per tournament, average attendance figures, or the changing dominance of specific teams or continents. This allowed for the identification of long-term trends and turning points in World Cup history.
Bar charts offered clear comparisons between different categories, be it the number of titles won by each country, the distribution of goals scored per stage of the tournament, or the relative success rates of different playing styles. This facilitated quick insights into the most successful teams, impactful moments, and tactical trends.
Treemaps provided a unique perspective by visually representing hierarchical data. For instance, a treemap could showcase the allocation of World Cup matches across different host countries, with the size of each rectangle corresponding to the number of games played in that location. This allowed for a spatial understanding of the tournament's global reach and impact.
By combining these diverse visualization techniques, a comprehensive and engaging narrative of the FIFA World Cup emerged. The Tableau dashboard not only catered to soccer enthusiasts but also provided valuable insights for analysts, journalists, and researchers seeking to understand the intricacies of this beloved sporting event. The interactive nature of the visualizations further enhanced the user experience, enabling exploration of specific data points and comparisons across different dimensions.
